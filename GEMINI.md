# Gemini Custom Policies and Information

## Policies
- I will not modify test files.
- I will not introduce new library dependencies without explicit user permission.
- I am permitted to create new test files as needed to validate my changes.
- Creating plans with non-existent `actionVerbs` is expected behavior. The system is designed to handle these novel verbs, and I should not attempt to "fix" or prevent them.

## File Hashes
- `services/agentset/src/agents/Step.ts`: 2a71644788de4315257a3e740875883d6a690223737b67362337728f32c7483e
