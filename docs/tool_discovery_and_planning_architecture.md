**Status:** This document has been consolidated into [`consolidated-verb-discovery-architecture.md`](docs/consolidated-verb-discovery-architecture.md)

**Migration Guide:** All concepts and implementation details from this document have been incorporated into the consolidated architecture with the following enhancements:

- Integrated with the phased approach from verb-discovery-architecture-proposal.md
- Added Brain Awareness section for LLM access to verb discovery
- Enhanced with caching mechanisms from verb-discovery-and-caching.md
- Incorporated implementation details from verb-architecture-consolidation-summary.md

**Key Sections Migrated:**
