## 🔧 Technical Infrastructure Delivered

### Plugin Development Ecosystem
```
Stage7 Plugin Development Framework
├── Python Templates & Examples
├── CLI Development Tools (python-plugin-cli.py)
├── Docker Integration (all containers)
├── Enhanced Execution Environment
├── Security & Validation Framework
└── Production Plugin Directory Structure
```

### Working Production Plugins
- **SEARCH_PYTHON**: DuckDuckGo search (tested and validated ✅)
- **FILE_OPS_PYTHON**: File operations (tested and validated ✅)
- **SEARCH**: JavaScript version (converted to file-based ✅)
- **FILE_OPS**: JavaScript version (converted to file-based ✅)

### New Plugin Structure (SOLVED THE PROBLEM)
```

├── SEARCH_PYTHON/
│   ├── main.py             # Separate, maintainable code
│   ├── manifest.json       # Clean, readable manifest
│   └── requirements.txt    # Proper dependency management
├── FILE_OPS_PYTHON/
│   ├── main.py             # Separate, maintainable code
│   ├── manifest.json       # Clean, readable manifest
│   └── requirements.txt    # Proper dependency management
├── SEARCH/
│   ├── SEARCH.js           # Extracted from embedded code
│   └── manifest.json       # Clean, no embedded code
└── FILE_OPS/
    ├── FILE_OPS.js         # Extracted from embedded code
    └── manifest.json       # Clean, no embedded code
```
