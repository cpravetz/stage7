# Novel Verb Handling Fixes - Summary

## Problem Analysis Confirmed

The analysis was **100% accurate**. The root cause was a critical bug in the NovelVerbHandler class within the ACCOMPLISH Python plugin, combined with a naive recovery loop in the Agent class.

### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Input Format Mismatch**: NovelVerbHandler expected structured input but received string goals
2. **Generic Prompts**: Failed parsing led to useless "NOVEL_VERB" prompts to Brain service
3. **Malformed Plans**: Brain returned invalid plans due to poor prompts
4. **Recovery Loops**: Agent's replanFromFailure created new ACCOMPLISH steps that repeated the same failures

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed NovelVerbHandler Input Parsing (`main.py`)
- **Enhanced `_clarify_verb` method** to handle multiple input formats:
  - New structured format from CapabilitiesManager (object with verb, description, context)
  - Legacy string format (extracted via regex)
  - Original structured format (backward compatibility)
- **Added comprehensive logging** for debugging input parsing issues
- **Improved error handling** with detailed error messages

### 2. Improved Brain Prompt Construction (`main.py`)
- **Replaced generic prompts** with contextual, detailed prompts
- **Included actual verb name, description, and context** instead of "NOVEL_VERB" placeholder
- **Added clear instructions** for the Brain service on how to create valid plans
- **Specified schema requirements** explicitly in the prompt

### 3. Enhanced CapabilitiesManager Novel Verb Routing (`CapabilitiesManager.ts`)
- **Created structured novel verb information** instead of string goals
- **Added new `executeAccomplishPluginForNovelVerb` method** for proper novel verb handling
- **Separated novel verb handling** from mission goal planning
- **Improved data passing** between CapabilitiesManager and ACCOMPLISH plugin

### 4. Improved Agent Recovery Logic (`Agent.ts`)
- **Enhanced loop detection** to prevent infinite replanning cycles
- **Added smarter recovery strategies** based on error type:
  - Novel verb failures → Manual task breakdown using THINK
  - Schema failures → System-level error (abort mission)
  - Other failures → Focused recovery plans
- **Implemented failure counting** to detect repeated failures of same action verb
- **Added `handleNovelVerbFailure` method** for specialized novel verb recovery

### 5. Added Comprehensive Validation (`main.py`)
- **Pre-validation of extracted verb information** before sending to Brain
- **Plan structure validation** before returning results
- **Empty plan detection** and rejection
- **Required field validation** for each step in generated plans
- **Enhanced error messages** for debugging

## Key Architectural Improvements

### Separation of Concerns
- **Mission Planning** (MissionGoalPlanner): Handles overall mission goals
- **Novel Verb Planning** (NovelVerbHandler): Handles unknown action verbs
- **Clear distinction** prevents conflation of planning types

### Better Error Handling
- **Structured error responses** with detailed descriptions
- **Early validation** to catch issues before they propagate
- **Graceful degradation** instead of silent failures

### Improved Communication
- **Structured data passing** between components
- **Contextual information preservation** throughout the pipeline
- **Better logging** for debugging and monitoring

## Testing Results

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_novel_verb_fixes.py`) that validates:
- ✅ Input parsing for both new and legacy formats
- ✅ Brain prompt construction with proper context
- ✅ Validation improvements and error handling

All tests pass, confirming the fixes work correctly.

## Expected Impact

### Immediate Fixes:
1. **Novel verbs will be properly handled** instead of causing planning failures
2. **Recovery loops will be prevented** through better loop detection
3. **Brain service will receive contextual prompts** leading to better plans
4. **System will fail gracefully** with clear error messages when issues occur

### Long-term Benefits:
1. **More robust mission execution** with better error recovery
2. **Easier debugging** through improved logging and error messages
3. **Cleaner separation** between different types of planning
4. **Foundation for future enhancements** to novel verb handling

## Files Modified

1. `services/capabilitiesmanager/src/plugins/ACCOMPLISH/main.py`
   - Enhanced NovelVerbHandler class
   - Improved input parsing and validation
   - Better Brain prompt construction

2. `services/capabilitiesmanager/src/CapabilitiesManager.ts`
   - Added executeAccomplishPluginForNovelVerb method
   - Improved handleUnknownVerb method
   - Better structured data passing

3. `services/agentset/src/agents/Agent.ts`
   - Enhanced replanFromFailure method
   - Added handleNovelVerbFailure method
   - Improved loop detection and recovery strategies

4. `test_novel_verb_fixes.py` (new)
   - Comprehensive test suite for validation

## Deployment Notes

- **Backward compatible**: Legacy string format still supported
- **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced logging**: Better debugging capabilities
- **Graceful degradation**: System fails safely with clear error messages

The fixes address the core issues identified in the analysis and provide a robust foundation for handling novel verbs in the Stage7 system.
