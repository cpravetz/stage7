# Step.ts Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the improvements made to Step.ts and the broader plugin system to eliminate excessive shared folder queries, replace shortcuts with production code, and implement a smarter strategy for making LLMs aware of available plugins.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Shared Folder Interactions from Step.ts ✅

**Problem**: Step.ts was excessively querying shared folders during step creation and execution.

**Solution**:
- Removed `uploadOutputsToSharedSpace()` method and related helper functions
- Eliminated `getFileExtensionForOutput()` and `getMimeTypeForOutput()` methods
- Removed `MissionFile` import as it's no longer needed
- Added comment directing shared folder interactions to plugins that need them (e.g., file_ops_python)

**Impact**: 
- Reduced unnecessary network calls during step execution
- Simplified Step.ts by removing ~150 lines of shared folder code
- Moved responsibility to appropriate plugins

### 2. Replaced Shortcuts and Hacks with Production Code ✅

**Problem**: Step.ts contained hardcoded plugin validation with comments like "In a real system, validPluginVerbs would be dynamically fetched".

**Solution**:
- Created `PluginValidator` interface for dynamic plugin validation
- Implemented `DefaultPluginValidator` class that queries CapabilitiesManager
- Added caching, timeout handling, and error recovery
- Replaced hardcoded verb lists with dynamic plugin discovery
- Added `refreshCache()` and `getPluginInfo()` methods for enhanced functionality

**Key Features**:
- 1-minute cache with automatic refresh
- Timeout protection (5 seconds)
- Graceful fallback to control flow verbs
- Detailed logging and error handling

### 3. Designed Plugin-Aware LLM Architecture ✅

**Problem**: LLMs were overwhelmed with large plugin lists, leading to poor plan generation.

**Solution**:
- Created comprehensive architecture design document
- Identified core components: PluginContextManager, Semantic Plugin Matcher, Plugin Summarizer, Context-Aware Filter
- Designed feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Planned phased implementation strategy

**Architecture Components**:
- **PluginContextManager**: Central orchestrator for plugin information
- **Semantic Plugin Matcher**: Vector-based relevance scoring
- **Plugin Summarizer**: Token-efficient descriptions
- **Context-Aware Filter**: Smart plugin selection
- **Plugin Metadata Cache**: Performance optimization

### 4. Implemented Dynamic Plugin Discovery ✅

**Problem**: Step validation used hardcoded lists instead of querying available plugins.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `DefaultPluginValidator` with robust error handling
- Added `fetchWithTimeout()` for reliable network calls
- Implemented comprehensive caching strategy
- Created plugin information retrieval methods

**Features**:
- Dynamic plugin verb validation
- Automatic cache refresh
- Network timeout protection
- Detailed plugin information retrieval

### 5. Optimized Plugin Information Delivery to LLMs ✅

**Problem**: No intelligent filtering or optimization of plugin information for LLMs.

**Solution**:
- Implemented `PluginContextManager` class with smart filtering
- Added relevance scoring based on goal analysis
- Created token budget management
- Integrated with CapabilitiesManager via new endpoint
- Updated ACCOMPLISH plugin to use optimized context

**Key Features**:
- Semantic relevance scoring
- Token count estimation and management
- Configurable constraints (max tokens, max plugins)
- Usage statistics tracking
- Formatted output optimized for LLMs

## Technical Implementation

   - Added PluginContextManager integration
   - Created `/generatePluginContext` endpoint
   - Enhanced plugin discovery capabilities

4. **`services/capabilitiesmanager/src/plugins/ACCOMPLISH/main.py`**:
   - Added optimized plugin context retrieval
   - Integrated with PluginContextManager
   - Enhanced goal-based plugin selection
