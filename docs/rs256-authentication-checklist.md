# RS256 Authentication Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure that RS256 authentication is properly implemented in your services.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Security service is running and accessible
- [ ] RS256 key pair is generated and distributed
- [ ] Environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Service registry is up-to-date

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Security Service

- [x] Update SecurityManager.ts to handle token verification
- [x] Implement proper service authentication
- [x] Add client authentication endpoint
- [x] Create scripts for key management
- [x] Add testing scripts

### 2. Shared Components

- [x] Fix ServiceTokenManager.verifyToken method
- [x] Fix ServiceTokenManager.getToken method
- [x] Enhance ServiceTokenManager.fetchPublicKey method
- [x] Fix BaseEntity.verifyToken method
- [x] Create authentication middleware

### 3. PostOffice Service

- [x] Apply authentication middleware to protected routes
- [x] Update WebSocket authentication
- [x] Test token verification

### 4. Other Services

- [ ] Apply authentication middleware to protected routes in all services
- [ ] Update service-to-service communication to include tokens
- [ ] Test token verification in all services

### 5. Client Applications

- [ ] Update client authentication flow
- [ ] Add token management to client applications
- [ ] Test client authentication

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run test-auth.js to verify token generation and verification
- [ ] Run test-client-auth.js to verify client authentication
- [ ] Run test-auth-e2e.js to verify end-to-end authentication
- [ ] Test authentication with invalid tokens
- [ ] Test authentication with expired tokens
- [ ] Test authentication with no tokens
- [ ] Test role-based access control

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Generate or rotate keys
- [ ] Distribute public key to all services
- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Restart all services
- [ ] Test authentication end-to-end
- [ ] Monitor authentication events

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Private key is only accessible to the security service
- [ ] Public key is distributed to all services
- [ ] Tokens are transmitted over HTTPS
- [ ] Tokens have appropriate expiration times
- [ ] Role-based access control is properly implemented
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are logged
- [ ] Key rotation is scheduled

## Documentation Checklist

- [x] Document authentication flow
- [x] Document token structure
- [x] Document key management
- [x] Document service registry
- [x] Document authentication middleware
- [x] Document role-based access control
- [x] Document testing procedures
- [x] Document deployment procedures
- [x] Document security considerations
- [x] Document troubleshooting procedures
