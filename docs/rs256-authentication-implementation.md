# RS256 Authentication Implementation

This document summarizes the changes made to implement RS256 authentication in the Stage7 platform.

## Overview

We have implemented a robust RS256-based authentication system that provides secure token generation, verification, and management for service-to-service and client-to-service communication.

## Key Components

1. **SecurityManager Service**:
   - Handles service and client authentication
   - Generates JWT tokens signed with RS256
   - Provides token verification endpoints
   - Manages the service registry

2. **ServiceTokenManager**:
   - Manages token lifecycle (fetching, caching, refreshing)
   - Provides token verification methods
   - Handles public key distribution

3. **BaseEntity**:
   - Includes token verification middleware
   - Provides a common authentication mechanism for all services

4. **Authentication Middleware**:
   - Protects routes from unauthorized access
   - Enforces role-based access control

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed ServiceTokenManager.verifyToken Method

- Removed the bypass code
- Implemented proper token verification using the SecurityManager service
- Added fallback to local verification only if SecurityManager is unavailable
- Improved error handling and logging

### 2. Fixed BaseEntity.verifyToken Method

- Removed the bypass code
- Implemented proper token verification using the ServiceTokenManager
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Added user information to the request object

### 3. Updated SecurityManager Service

- Enhanced token verification endpoint to accept tokens from Authorization header
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added client authentication endpoint
- Updated environment variables for better configuration

### 4. Added Authentication Middleware

- Created reusable middleware for token verification
- Implemented role-based access control
- Applied middleware to protected routes in PostOffice service

### 5. Improved Key Management

- Created scripts for key generation and rotation
- Enhanced public key distribution mechanism
- Added backup functionality for keys

### 6. Added Testing Scripts

- Created test scripts for token generation and verification
- Added client authentication testing
- Implemented end-to-end authentication testing

### 7. Added Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation for the authentication system
- Added examples of how to use the authentication system
- Documented best practices and security considerations

## Security Improvements

1. **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Using RS256 instead of HS256 for better security
2. **Token Verification**: Proper verification of tokens with no bypassing
3. **Key Management**: Secure key generation, distribution, and rotation
4. **Role-Based Access Control**: Fine-grained access control based on roles
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging for security events

## Testing and Deployment

1. **Test Scripts**: Multiple test scripts to verify the authentication system
2. **Deployment Script**: Script to help with deploying the authentication system
3. **Key Rotation**: Script to rotate keys for enhanced security

## Next Steps

1. **Service Integration**: Integrate the authentication system with all services
2. **Client Integration**: Update client applications to use the authentication system
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring and alerting for authentication events
4. **Key Rotation Schedule**: Establish a regular key rotation schedule
5. **Security Auditing**: Implement security auditing for authentication events
