# Authentication and Authorization Improvements

This document describes the authentication and authorization improvements implemented in the Stage7 system, including the enhanced user model, role-based access control, token management, and API security.

## 1. Enhanced User Model

### Overview

The user model has been enhanced to include more detailed information about users, including their roles, permissions, and security-related fields.

### Implementation

The user model now includes:

1. **Basic Information**: ID, username, email, first name, last name
2. **Authentication**: Password, authentication provider, provider user ID
3. **Authorization**: Roles, permissions
4. **Security**: Email verification status, MFA status, failed login attempts, lockout information
5. **Timestamps**: Created at, updated at, last login
6. **Preferences**: User preferences

### Key Features

- **Multiple Roles**: Users can have multiple roles
- **Direct Permissions**: Users can have permissions assigned directly to them
- **Email Verification**: Support for email verification
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support for MFA
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Overview

A comprehensive role-based access control system has been implemented to manage user permissions and access to resources.

### Implementation

The RBAC system includes:

1. **Roles**: Predefined and custom roles with descriptions
2. **Permissions**: Granular permissions for different resources and actions
3. **Permission Conditions**: Context-based permission evaluation
4. **Role Assignment**: Ability to assign roles to users
5. **Permission Assignment**: Ability to assign permissions directly to users

### Key Features

- **Hierarchical Roles**: System roles with different levels of access
- **Resource-Based Permissions**: Permissions are tied to specific resources
- **Action-Based Permissions**: Permissions are tied to specific actions
- **Scope-Based Permissions**: Permissions can be scoped to specific contexts (e.g., own resources)
- **Wildcard Permissions**: Support for wildcard permissions

## 3. Token Management

### Overview

A comprehensive token management system has been implemented to handle JWT tokens securely.

### Implementation

The token management system includes:

1. **Token Types**: Access tokens, refresh tokens, verification tokens, password reset tokens, API tokens
2. **Token Generation**: Secure token generation with proper claims
3. **Token Verification**: Secure token verification with proper validation
4. **Token Revocation**: Ability to revoke tokens
5. **Token Blacklisting**: Prevention of token reuse after revocation
6. **Token Rotation**: Automatic token rotation for security

### Key Features

- **Short-Lived Access Tokens**: Access tokens expire quickly for security
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived refresh tokens for seamless user experience
- **Token Revocation**: Ability to revoke tokens on logout or security events
- **Token Blacklisting**: Prevention of token reuse after revocation
- **Client Information**: Tokens include client information for auditing

## 4. Authentication Flows

### Overview

Enhanced authentication flows have been implemented to provide a secure and user-friendly authentication experience.

### Implementation

The authentication flows include:

1. **Registration**: Secure user registration with email verification
2. **Login**: Secure login with protection against brute force attacks
3. **Logout**: Secure logout with token revocation
4. **Password Reset**: Secure password reset flow
5. **Email Verification**: Secure email verification flow
6. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Secure MFA flow

### Key Features

- **Email Verification**: Users must verify their email address
- **MFA Support**: Support for multi-factor authentication
- **Account Lockout**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Password Reset**: Secure password reset flow
- **Token Refresh**: Seamless token refresh for user experience

## 5. API Security

### Overview

Enhanced API security measures have been implemented to protect the API from common attacks.

### Implementation

The API security measures include:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
2. **CSRF Protection**: Protection against cross-site request forgery
3. **Security Headers**: Protection against various attacks
4. **CORS**: Protection against cross-origin resource sharing issues
5. **Error Handling**: Secure error handling to prevent information leakage

### Key Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Different rate limits for different endpoints
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF protection
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS configuration
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling with proper logging

## 6. User Management

### Overview

Enhanced user management features have been implemented to provide administrators with the ability to manage users.

### Implementation

The user management features include:

1. **User Creation**: Ability to create users
2. **User Retrieval**: Ability to retrieve user information
3. **User Update**: Ability to update user information
4. **User Deletion**: Ability to delete users
5. **Role Management**: Ability to assign and remove roles
6. **Permission Management**: Ability to assign and remove permissions

### Key Features

- **User Search**: Ability to search for users
- **Pagination**: Pagination for user lists
- **Role Assignment**: Ability to assign roles to users
- **Permission Assignment**: Ability to assign permissions to users
- **User Status**: Ability to enable/disable users

## 7. Future Improvements

While significant improvements have been made to the authentication and authorization system, there are still areas that could be enhanced in the future:

1. **OAuth Integration**: Add support for OAuth providers
2. **SAML Integration**: Add support for SAML providers
3. **Advanced MFA**: Add support for more MFA methods (e.g., WebAuthn, FIDO2)
4. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit logging for security events
5. **User Sessions**: Add support for managing user sessions
6. **IP-Based Security**: Add IP-based security features
7. **Geo-Based Security**: Add geo-based security features
8. **Device Management**: Add support for managing user devices
9. **Password Policies**: Add support for configurable password policies
10. **Role Hierarchies**: Add support for role hierarchies
