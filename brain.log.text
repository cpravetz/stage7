THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we will implement a strategic plan focused on understanding the market, identifying key opportunities, and executing a targeted go-to-market strategy. The approach will be cyclical, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation based on feedback and market dynamics. The plan will leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs to enhance research, user persona development, and content creation, ensuring that stage7 stands out in a competitive landscape.\n\nThe first phase, Discovery & Analysis, will involve a deep dive into the competitive landscape to identify key players and their strengths and weaknesses. We will research five key competitors, analyzing their features, user bases, and market positioning. Concurrently, we will define three primary user personas, each with specific pain points that stage7 can address. This phase will set the foundation for understanding the market and user needs, ensuring that subsequent efforts are aligned with real-world demands. LLMs can assist in this phase by analyzing large volumes of data from forums, reviews, and social media to identify common pain points and market trends.\n\nIn the Opportunity Identification phase, we will generate a list of ten potential system enhancements using the Moscow method to prioritize them based on their impact and feasibility. These enhancements will be mapped to the user personas and their pain points, ensuring that our efforts are user-centric. We will estimate the effort required for each enhancement using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL) to prioritize our development roadmap. This phase will be crucial in identifying the most impactful features that can drive rapid growth in stars and forks on GitHub. LLMs can be used to generate initial ideas for enhancements and to analyze user feedback for potential improvements.\n\nThe Business Case Development phase will involve creating detailed business cases for the top three opportunities identified in the previous phase. Each business case will include an assessment of the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. This phase will ensure that we invest our resources in the most promising opportunities that can drive significant growth. The final phase, Go-To-Market Strategy, will focus on developing a 90-day launch plan that includes target audience segmentation, key messaging and positioning, channel strategy, and content calendar. We will also implement community-building tactics to foster engagement and drive adoption. LLMs can assist in creating compelling content and messaging that resonates with our target audience, ensuring that our launch is impactful and drives rapid growth.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that each phase builds on the insights and learnings from the previous one, creating a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement. By leveraging LLMs, we can enhance our research, user understanding, and content creation, ensuring that stage7 stands out in a competitive market. The focus on rapid growth in stars and forks will be achieved through targeted enhancements, effective messaging, and community engagement, establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\n---\n\n**3.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE GOAL:**\n---\nYou are the Product Manager for stage7, an open source agentic platform. Your mission is to accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\nSuccess is measured by the number of stars and the number of forks the project gets on github. Track both velocity (growth rate) and absolute numbers, as rapid growth often matters more than current totals for emerging projects.  The project url is github.com/cpravetz/stage7 \n\nWhilst your responsibilities will be on-going, they are also cyclical.  An initial framework follows, but you should revise your work based on the experience and knowledge you gain.\nAt the end of each phase, reflect on:\n- What assumptions were validated or invalidated?\n- What new insights emerged about users or market?\n- How should the next cycle be adjusted?\n\nPHASE 1 - DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS\n1. Research competitive landscape (identify 5 key competitors)\n2. Define 3 primary user personas with specific pain points\n\nPHASE 2 - OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION  \n1. Identify 10 potential system enhancements using the Moscow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Map enhancements to user personas and pain points\n3. Estimate effort using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)\n\nPHASE 3 - BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT\nCreate detailed business cases for the top 3 opportunities including:\n- Market opportunity size\n- Technical feasibility assessment\n- Resource requirements\n- Success metrics and timeline\n\nPHASE 4 - GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY\nDevelop a 90-day launch plan including:\n- Target audience segmentation\n- Key messaging and positioning\n- Channel strategy and content calendar\n- Community building tactics\n\nFor each deliverable, provide specific, actionable recommendations with clear next steps and success metrics.\n---\n\n**2. THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we will implement a strategic plan focused on understanding the market, identifying key opportunities, and executing a targeted go-to-market strategy. The approach will be cyclical, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation based on feedback and market dynamics. The plan will leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs to enhance research, user persona development, and content creation, ensuring that stage7 stands out in a competitive landscape.\n\nThe first phase, Discovery & Analysis, will involve a deep dive into the competitive landscape to identify key players and their strengths and weaknesses. We will research five key competitors, analyzing their features, user bases, and market positioning. Concurrently, we will define three primary user personas, each with specific pain points that stage7 can address. This phase will set the foundation for understanding the market and user needs, ensuring that subsequent efforts are aligned with real-world demands. LLMs can assist in this phase by analyzing large volumes of data from forums, reviews, and social media to identify common pain points and market trends.\n\nIn the Opportunity Identification phase, we will generate a list of ten potential system enhancements using the Moscow method to prioritize them based on their impact and feasibility. These enhancements will be mapped to the user personas and their pain points, ensuring that our efforts are user-centric. We will estimate the effort required for each enhancement using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL) to prioritize our development roadmap. This phase will be crucial in identifying the most impactful features that can drive rapid growth in stars and forks on GitHub. LLMs can be used to generate initial ideas for enhancements and to analyze user feedback for potential improvements.\n\nThe Business Case Development phase will involve creating detailed business cases for the top three opportunities identified in the previous phase. Each business case will include an assessment of the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. This phase will ensure that we invest our resources in the most promising opportunities that can drive significant growth. The final phase, Go-To-Market Strategy, will focus on developing a 90-day launch plan that includes target audience segmentation, key messaging and positioning, channel strategy, and content calendar. We will also implement community-building tactics to foster engagement and drive adoption. LLMs can assist in creating compelling content and messaging that resonates with our target audience, ensuring that our launch is impactful and drives rapid growth.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that each phase builds on the insights and learnings from the previous one, creating a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement. By leveraging LLMs, we can enhance our research, user understanding, and content creation, ensuring that stage7 stands out in a competitive market. The focus on rapid growth in stars and forks will be achieved through targeted enhancements, effective messaging, and community engagement, establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\n---\n\n**3.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE GOAL:**\n---\nYou are the Product Manager for stage7, an open source agentic platform. Your mission is to accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\nSuccess is measured by the number of stars and the number of forks the project gets on github. Track both velocity (growth rate) and absolute numbers, as rapid growth often matters more than current totals for emerging projects.  The project url is github.com/cpravetz/stage7 \n\nWhilst your responsibilities will be on-going, they are also cyclical.  An initial framework follows, but you should revise your work based on the experience and knowledge you gain.\nAt the end of each phase, reflect on:\n- What assumptions were validated or invalidated?\n- What new insights emerged about users or market?\n- How should the next cycle be adjusted?\n\nPHASE 1 - DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS\n1. Research competitive landscape (identify 5 key competitors)\n2. Define 3 primary user personas with specific pain points\n\nPHASE 2 - OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION  \n1. Identify 10 potential system enhancements using the Moscow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Map enhancements to user personas and pain points\n3. Estimate effort using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)\n\nPHASE 3 - BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT\nCreate detailed business cases for the top 3 opportunities including:\n- Market opportunity size\n- Technical feasibility assessment\n- Resource requirements\n- Success metrics and timeline\n\nPHASE 4 - GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY\nDevelop a 90-day launch plan including:\n- Target audience segmentation\n- Key messaging and positioning\n- Channel strategy and content calendar\n- Community building tactics\n\nFor each deliverable, provide specific, actionable recommendations with clear next steps and success metrics.\n---\n\n**2. THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we will implement a strategic plan focused on understanding the market, identifying key opportunities, and executing a targeted go-to-market strategy. The approach will be cyclical, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation based on feedback and market dynamics. The plan will leverage the unique capabilities of LLMs to enhance research, user persona development, and content creation, ensuring that stage7 stands out in a competitive landscape.\n\nThe first phase, Discovery & Analysis, will involve a deep dive into the competitive landscape to identify key players and their strengths and weaknesses. We will research five key competitors, analyzing their features, user bases, and market positioning. Concurrently, we will define three primary user personas, each with specific pain points that stage7 can address. This phase will set the foundation for understanding the market and user needs, ensuring that subsequent efforts are aligned with real-world demands. LLMs can assist in this phase by analyzing large volumes of data from forums, reviews, and social media to identify common pain points and market trends.\n\nIn the Opportunity Identification phase, we will generate a list of ten potential system enhancements using the Moscow method to prioritize them based on their impact and feasibility. These enhancements will be mapped to the user personas and their pain points, ensuring that our efforts are user-centric. We will estimate the effort required for each enhancement using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL) to prioritize our development roadmap. This phase will be crucial in identifying the most impactful features that can drive rapid growth in stars and forks on GitHub. LLMs can be used to generate initial ideas for enhancements and to analyze user feedback for potential improvements.\n\nThe Business Case Development phase will involve creating detailed business cases for the top three opportunities identified in the previous phase. Each business case will include an assessment of the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. This phase will ensure that we invest our resources in the most promising opportunities that can drive significant growth. The final phase, Go-To-Market Strategy, will focus on developing a 90-day launch plan that includes target audience segmentation, key messaging and positioning, channel strategy, and content calendar. We will also implement community-building tactics to foster engagement and drive adoption. LLMs can assist in creating compelling content and messaging that resonates with our target audience, ensuring that our launch is impactful and drives rapid growth.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that each phase builds on the insights and learnings from the previous one, creating a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement. By leveraging LLMs, we can enhance our research, user understanding, and content creation, ensuring that stage7 stands out in a competitive market.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accomplish the goal of accelerating adoption and establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we need to focus on a strategic approach that leverages community engagement, targeted enhancements, and effective marketing. The key phases of work will include community analysis, feature prioritization, and a robust go-to-market strategy. By understanding the community's needs and pain points, we can identify high-impact features that will drive adoption. Additionally, leveraging LLMs can help automate parts of the process, such as analyzing community feedback and generating marketing content.\n\nThe first phase will involve a deep dive into the existing community and competitive landscape. We will analyze the current GitHub repository, including issues, pull requests, and discussions, to understand what users are asking for and what pain points they are experiencing. This will help us define primary user personas and identify key competitors. The second phase will focus on identifying potential system enhancements using the MoSCoW method, mapping these enhancements to user personas, and estimating the effort required for each. This will help us prioritize features that will have the most significant impact on user adoption.\n\nThe third phase will involve developing detailed business cases for the top three opportunities. This will include assessing the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. The final phase will be the go-to-market strategy, which will include a 90-day launch plan with target audience segmentation, key messaging, channel strategy, and community building tactics. By following this approach, we can ensure that we are addressing the most critical user needs, leveraging the community's feedback, and effectively marketing the platform to drive adoption. This comprehensive plan will help us achieve the goal of establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\n---\n\n**3.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE GOAL:**\n---\n\n**Recovery Task:** The step \"ACCOMPLISH\" failed.\n\n**Original Mission:** You are the Product Manager for stage7, an open source agentic platform. Your mission is to accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\nSuccess is measured by the number of stars and the number of forks the project gets on github. Track both velocity (growth rate) and absolute numbers, as rapid growth often matters more than current totals for emerging projects.  The project url is github.com/cpravetz/stage7 \n\nWhilst your responsibilities will be on-going, they are also cyclical.  An initial framework follows, but you should revise your work based on the experience and knowledge you gain.\nAt the end of each phase, reflect on:\n- What assumptions were validated or invalidated?\n- What new insights emerged about users or market?\n- How should the next cycle be adjusted?\n\nPHASE 1 - DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS\n1. Research competitive landscape (identify 5 key competitors)\n2. Define 3 primary user personas with specific pain points\n\nPHASE 2 - OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION  \n1. Identify 10 potential system enhancements using the Moscow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Map enhancements to user personas and pain points\n3. Estimate effort using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)\n\nPHASE 3 - BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT\nCreate detailed business cases for the top 3 opportunities including:\n- Market opportunity size\n- Technical feasibility assessment\n- Resource requirements\n- Success metrics and timeline\n\nPHASE 4 - GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY\nDevelop a 90-day launch plan including:\n- Target audience segmentation\n- Key messaging and positioning\n- Channel strategy and content calendar\n- Community building tactics\n\nFor each deliverable, provide specific, actionable recommendations with clear next steps and success metrics.\n\n**Completed Work:** Completed Work Products:\n\n\n**Instructions:** Create a simple, alternative approach to accomplish what the failed step was trying to do. Your new plan should use the step inputs and produce the step outputs. Do not repeat the failed approach.\n        \n---\n\n**2. THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accomplish the goal of accelerating adoption and establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we need to focus on a strategic approach that leverages community engagement, targeted enhancements, and effective marketing. The key phases of work will include community analysis, feature prioritization, and a robust go-to-market strategy. By understanding the community's needs and pain points, we can identify high-impact features that will drive adoption. Additionally, leveraging LLMs can help automate parts of the process, such as analyzing community feedback and generating marketing content.\n\nThe first phase will involve a deep dive into the existing community and competitive landscape. We will analyze the current GitHub repository, including issues, pull requests, and discussions, to understand what users are asking for and what pain points they are experiencing. This will help us define primary user personas and identify key competitors. The second phase will focus on identifying potential system enhancements using the MoSCoW method, mapping these enhancements to user personas, and estimating the effort required for each. This will help us prioritize features that will have the most significant impact on user adoption.\n\nThe third phase will involve developing detailed business cases for the top three opportunities. This will include assessing the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. The final phase will be the go-to-market strategy, which will include a 90-day launch plan with target audience segmentation, key messaging, channel strategy, and community building tactics. By following this approach, we can ensure that we are addressing the most critical user needs, leveraging the community's feedback, and effectively marketing the platform to drive adoption.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE GOAL:**\n---\n\n**Recovery Task:** The step \"ACCOMPLISH\" failed.\n\n**Original Mission:** You are the Product Manager for stage7, an open source agentic platform. Your mission is to accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\nSuccess is measured by the number of stars and the number of forks the project gets on github. Track both velocity (growth rate) and absolute numbers, as rapid growth often matters more than current totals for emerging projects.  The project url is github.com/cpravetz/stage7 \n\nWhilst your responsibilities will be on-going, they are also cyclical.  An initial framework follows, but you should revise your work based on the experience and knowledge you gain.\nAt the end of each phase, reflect on:\n- What assumptions were validated or invalidated?\n- What new insights emerged about users or market?\n- How should the next cycle be adjusted?\n\nPHASE 1 - DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS\n1. Research competitive landscape (identify 5 key competitors)\n2. Define 3 primary user personas with specific pain points\n\nPHASE 2 - OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION  \n1. Identify 10 potential system enhancements using the Moscow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Map enhancements to user personas and pain points\n3. Estimate effort using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)\n\nPHASE 3 - BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT\nCreate detailed business cases for the top 3 opportunities including:\n- Market opportunity size\n- Technical feasibility assessment\n- Resource requirements\n- Success metrics and timeline\n\nPHASE 4 - GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY\nDevelop a 90-day launch plan including:\n- Target audience segmentation\n- Key messaging and positioning\n- Channel strategy and content calendar\n- Community building tactics\n\nFor each deliverable, provide specific, actionable recommendations with clear next steps and success metrics.\n\n**Completed Work:** Completed Work Products:\n\n\n**Instructions:** Create a simple, alternative approach to accomplish what the failed step was trying to do. Your new plan should use the step inputs and produce the step outputs. Do not repeat the failed approach.\n        \n---\n\n**2. THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accomplish the goal of accelerating adoption and establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we need to focus on a strategic approach that leverages community engagement, targeted enhancements, and effective marketing. The key phases of work will include community analysis, feature prioritization, and a robust go-to-market strategy. By understanding the community's needs and pain points, we can identify high-impact features that will drive adoption. Additionally, leveraging LLMs can help automate parts of the process, such as analyzing community feedback and generating marketing content.\n\nThe first phase will involve a deep dive into the existing community and competitive landscape. We will analyze the current GitHub repository, including issues, pull requests, and discussions, to understand what users are asking for and what pain points they are experiencing. This will help us define primary user personas and identify key competitors. The second phase will focus on identifying potential system enhancements using the MoSCoW method, mapping these enhancements to user personas, and estimating the effort required for each. This will help us prioritize features that will have the most significant impact on user adoption.\n\nThe third phase will involve developing detailed business cases for the top three opportunities. This will include assessing the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. The final phase will be the go-to-market strategy, which will include a 90-day launch plan with target audience segmentation, key messaging, channel strategy, and community building tactics. By following this approach, we can ensure that we are addressing the most critical user needs, leveraging the community's feedback, and effectively marketing the platform to drive adoption. This comprehensive plan will help us achieve the goal of establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\n---\n\n**3.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accomplish the goal of accelerating adoption and establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we need to focus on a strategic approach that leverages community engagement, targeted enhancements, and effective marketing. The key phases of work will include community analysis, feature prioritization, and a robust go-to-market strategy. By understanding the community's needs and pain points, we can prioritize features that will drive the most value and adoption. This approach will ensure that the project gains traction quickly and maintains momentum over time.\n\nThe first phase will involve a deep dive into the existing community and competitive landscape. We will analyze the current state of the stage7 GitHub repository, including the number of stars, forks, and active contributors. We will also identify key competitors and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This research will help us understand the market dynamics and identify opportunities for differentiation. Additionally, we will define primary user personas based on the existing community and potential users. This will involve creating detailed profiles of users, including their pain points, goals, and behaviors. By understanding these personas, we can tailor our enhancements and marketing efforts to meet their specific needs.\n\nThe second phase will focus on identifying and prioritizing system enhancements. We will use the Moscow method to categorize potential enhancements into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have. This will help us focus on the most impactful features that will drive adoption and engagement. We will map these enhancements to the user personas and pain points identified in the previous phase. This mapping will ensure that our enhancements are aligned with the needs of our target users. We will also estimate the effort required for each enhancement using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL). This will help us prioritize features based on their impact and feasibility.\n\nThe third phase will involve creating detailed business cases for the top three opportunities. Each business case will include an assessment of the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. We will also develop a timeline for each enhancement. This will help us understand the potential impact of each enhancement and make informed decisions about which features to prioritize. Additionally, we will leverage LLMs to analyze community feedback and identify emerging trends and pain points. This will help us stay ahead of the curve and ensure that our enhancements are aligned with the evolving needs of our users.\n\nThe final phase will focus on developing a 90-day launch plan. This plan will include target audience segmentation, key messaging and positioning, channel strategy, and content calendar. We will also develop community building tactics to foster engagement and drive adoption. By leveraging the insights gained from the previous phases, we can create a targeted and effective go-to-market strategy. This will ensure that our enhancements are well-received by the community and drive significant growth in stars and forks. By following this strategic approach, we can accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\n---\n\n**3.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE GOAL:**\n---\n\n**Recovery Task:** The step \"ACCOMPLISH\" failed.\n\n**Original Mission:** You are the Product Manager for stage7, an open source agentic platform. Your mission is to accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\nSuccess is measured by the number of stars and the number of forks the project gets on github. Track both velocity (growth rate) and absolute numbers, as rapid growth often matters more than current totals for emerging projects.  The project url is github.com/cpravetz/stage7 \n\nWhilst your responsibilities will be on-going, they are also cyclical.  An initial framework follows, but you should revise your work based on the experience and knowledge you gain.\nAt the end of each phase, reflect on:\n- What assumptions were validated or invalidated?\n- What new insights emerged about users or market?\n- How should the next cycle be adjusted?\n\nPHASE 1 - DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS\n1. Research competitive landscape (identify 5 key competitors)\n2. Define 3 primary user personas with specific pain points\n\nPHASE 2 - OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION  \n1. Identify 10 potential system enhancements using the Moscow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Map enhancements to user personas and pain points\n3. Estimate effort using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)\n\nPHASE 3 - BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT\nCreate detailed business cases for the top 3 opportunities including:\n- Market opportunity size\n- Technical feasibility assessment\n- Resource requirements\n- Success metrics and timeline\n\nPHASE 4 - GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY\nDevelop a 90-day launch plan including:\n- Target audience segmentation\n- Key messaging and positioning\n- Channel strategy and content calendar\n- Community building tactics\n\nFor each deliverable, provide specific, actionable recommendations with clear next steps and success metrics.\n\n**Completed Work:** Completed Work Products:\n\n\n**Instructions:** Create a simple, alternative approach to accomplish what the failed step was trying to do. Your new plan should use the step inputs and produce the step outputs. Do not repeat the failed approach.\n        \n---\n\n**2. THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accomplish the goal of accelerating adoption and establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we need to focus on a strategic approach that leverages community engagement, targeted enhancements, and effective marketing. The key phases of work will include community analysis, feature prioritization, and a robust go-to-market strategy. By understanding the community's needs and pain points, we can prioritize features that will drive the most value and adoption. This approach will ensure that the project gains traction quickly and maintains momentum over time.\n\nThe first phase will involve a deep dive into the existing community and competitive landscape. We will analyze the current state of the stage7 GitHub repository, including the number of stars, forks, and active contributors. We will also identify key competitors and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This research will help us understand the market dynamics and identify opportunities for differentiation. Additionally, we will define primary user personas based on the existing community and potential users. This will involve creating detailed profiles of users, including their pain points, goals, and behaviors. By understanding these personas, we can tailor our enhancements and marketing efforts to meet their specific needs.\n\nThe second phase will focus on identifying and prioritizing system enhancements. We will use the Moscow method to categorize potential enhancements into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have. This will help us focus on the most impactful features that will drive adoption and engagement. We will map these enhancements to the user personas and pain points identified in the previous phase. This mapping will ensure that our enhancements are aligned with the needs of our target users. We will also estimate the effort required for each enhancement using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL). This will help us prioritize features based on their impact and feasibility.\n\nThe third phase will involve creating detailed business cases for the top three opportunities. Each business case will include an assessment of the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. We will also develop a timeline for each enhancement. This will help us understand the potential impact of each enhancement and make informed decisions about which features to prioritize. Additionally, we will leverage LLMs to analyze community feedback and identify emerging trends and pain points. This will help us stay ahead of the curve and ensure that our enhancements are aligned with the evolving needs of our users.\n\nThe final phase will focus on developing a 90-day launch plan. This plan will include target audience segmentation, key messaging and positioning, channel strategy, and content calendar. We will also develop community building tactics to foster engagement and drive adoption. By leveraging the insights gained from the previous phases, we can create a targeted and effective go-to-market strategy. This will ensure that our enhancements are well-received by the community and drive significant growth in stars and forks. By following this strategic approach, we can accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\n---\n\n**3.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"

THE GOAL:**\n---\n\n**Recovery Task:** The step \"ACCOMPLISH\" failed.\n\n**Original Mission:** You are the Product Manager for stage7, an open source agentic platform. Your mission is to accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\nSuccess is measured by the number of stars and the number of forks the project gets on github. Track both velocity (growth rate) and absolute numbers, as rapid growth often matters more than current totals for emerging projects.  The project url is github.com/cpravetz/stage7 \n\nWhilst your responsibilities will be on-going, they are also cyclical.  An initial framework follows, but you should revise your work based on the experience and knowledge you gain.\nAt the end of each phase, reflect on:\n- What assumptions were validated or invalidated?\n- What new insights emerged about users or market?\n- How should the next cycle be adjusted?\n\nPHASE 1 - DISCOVERY & ANALYSIS\n1. Research competitive landscape (identify 5 key competitors)\n2. Define 3 primary user personas with specific pain points\n\nPHASE 2 - OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION  \n1. Identify 10 potential system enhancements using the Moscow method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)\n2. Map enhancements to user personas and pain points\n3. Estimate effort using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL)\n\nPHASE 3 - BUSINESS CASE DEVELOPMENT\nCreate detailed business cases for the top 3 opportunities including:\n- Market opportunity size\n- Technical feasibility assessment\n- Resource requirements\n- Success metrics and timeline\n\nPHASE 4 - GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY\nDevelop a 90-day launch plan including:\n- Target audience segmentation\n- Key messaging and positioning\n- Channel strategy and content calendar\n- Community building tactics\n\nFor each deliverable, provide specific, actionable recommendations with clear next steps and success metrics.\n\n**Completed Work:** Completed Work Products:\n\n\n**Instructions:** Create a simple, alternative approach to accomplish what the failed step was trying to do. Your new plan should use the step inputs and produce the step outputs. Do not repeat the failed approach.\n        \n---\n\n**2. THE PROSE PLAN:**\n---\nTo accomplish the goal of accelerating adoption and establishing stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space, we need to focus on a strategic approach that leverages community engagement, targeted enhancements, and effective marketing. The key phases of work will include community analysis, feature prioritization, and a robust go-to-market strategy. By understanding the community's needs and pain points, we can prioritize features that will drive the most value and adoption. This approach will ensure that the project gains traction quickly and maintains momentum over time.\n\nThe first phase will involve a deep dive into the existing community and competitive landscape. We will analyze the current state of the stage7 GitHub repository, including the number of stars, forks, and active contributors. We will also identify key competitors and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. This research will help us understand the market dynamics and identify opportunities for differentiation. Additionally, we will define primary user personas based on the existing community and potential users. This will involve creating detailed profiles of users, including their pain points, goals, and behaviors. By understanding these personas, we can tailor our enhancements and marketing efforts to meet their specific needs.\n\nThe second phase will focus on identifying and prioritizing system enhancements. We will use the Moscow method to categorize potential enhancements into Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't have. This will help us focus on the most impactful features that will drive adoption and engagement. We will map these enhancements to the user personas and pain points identified in the previous phase. This mapping will ensure that our enhancements are aligned with the needs of our target users. We will also estimate the effort required for each enhancement using t-shirt sizing (S/M/L/XL). This will help us prioritize features based on their impact and feasibility.\n\nThe third phase will involve creating detailed business cases for the top three opportunities. Each business case will include an assessment of the market opportunity size, technical feasibility, resource requirements, and success metrics. We will also develop a timeline for each enhancement. This will help us understand the potential impact of each enhancement and make informed decisions about which features to prioritize. Additionally, we will leverage LLMs to analyze community feedback and identify emerging trends and pain points. This will help us stay ahead of the curve and ensure that our enhancements are aligned with the evolving needs of our users.\n\nThe final phase will focus on developing a 90-day launch plan. This plan will include target audience segmentation, key messaging and positioning, channel strategy, and content calendar. We will also develop community building tactics to foster engagement and drive adoption. By leveraging the insights gained from the previous phases, we can create a targeted and effective go-to-market strategy. This will ensure that our enhancements are well-received by the community and drive significant growth in stars and forks. By following this strategic approach, we can accelerate adoption and establish stage7 as a leading platform in the agentic AI space.\n---\n\n**3.

YOUR TASK:**\nFollow these steps to create the final JSON output:\n\n**STEP A: Internal Analysis & Self-Correction (Your Internal Monologue)**\n1.  **Analyze:** Read the Goal and Prose Plan to fully understand the user's intent and the required sequence of actions.\n2.  **Verify Schema:** Carefully study the JSON SCHEMA. Your output must follow it perfectly.\n3.  **Restate the Plan as Explicit Steps:** Identify a list of steps that will be taken to achieve the Goal. Each Step should be a clear, actionable task with one or more outputs.\n4.  **Check Dependencies:** For each step, ensure its `inputs` that depend on previous steps correctly reference the `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n5.  **Validate Inputs:** Ensure every input for each step has either a static `value` or a dynamic `outputName` and `sourceStep` reference from a prior step.\n6.  **Final Check:** Before generating the output, perform a final check to ensure the entire JSON structure is valid and fully compliant with the schema.\n\n**STEP B: Generate Final JSON (Your Final Output)**\nAfter your internal analysis and self-correction is complete, provide ONLY the final, valid JSON array of steps.\n\n**CRITICAL DEPENDENCY RULES:**\n- **Multi-step plans are essential:** Break down complex goals into multiple, sequential steps.\n- **Dependencies are crucial for flow:** Every step that uses an output from a previous step MUST declare that dependency in its `inputs` object using `outputName` and `sourceStep`.\n- **CRITICAL for sourceStep:**\n    - Use `sourceStep: 0` ONLY for inputs that are explicitly provided in the initial mission context (the \"PARENT STEP INPUTS\" section if applicable, or the overall mission goal).\n    - For any other input, it MUST be the `outputName` from a *preceding step* in this plan, and `sourceStep` MUST be the `number` of that preceding step.\n    - Every input in your plan MUST be resolvable either from the initial mission context (using `sourceStep: 0`) or from an output of a previous step in the plan.\n- **For 'THINK' actionVerb:** The `inputs` for 'THINK' MUST include a `prompt` field with a string value that clearly states the thinking task.\n- **Example for `sourceStep`:** If Step 2 needs `research_results` from Step 1, and Step 1 outputs `{ \"research_results\": \"...\" }`, then Step 2's inputs would be `{ \"research\": {'outputName': \"research_results\", \"sourceStep\": 1, \"valueType\": \"string\"} }`.\n\nNo plugins are available for use in the plan.\n"
