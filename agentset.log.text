2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 |     Remediation Guidance:
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 |     ANALYSIS:
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | The error is a 413 status code, which indicates a "Payload Too Large" HTTP error. This occurs when the request entity is larger than the server is willing or able to process. The error originates from an Axios POST request in AgentPersistenceManager.js where the agent state data being sent is too large for the server to handle. The error propagates through the call stack from AgentSet.js down to the AgentPersistenceManager.
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | The issue likely stems from:
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 1. The agent state data being too large (possibly due to large conversation history, inputs, or other agent state data)
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 2. No payload size limit handling in the client code
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 3. No server-side configuration to handle larger payloads
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | RECOMMENDATIONS:
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 1. Implement payload size validation before sending the request
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 2. Add error handling specifically for 413 errors
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 3. Consider compressing the payload before sending
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 4. Implement chunking for very large payloads
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 5. Add logging to track payload sizes
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 6. Consider server-side configuration to increase payload limits if appropriate

2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | Additional improvements:
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 1. Add compression middleware in the server to handle larger payloads

2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 3. Add metrics to track payload sizes and failure rates
2025-07-28 15:40:48.989 | 4. Consider using streaming for very large payloads instead of sending all at once
