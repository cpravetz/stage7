# SECURITY ALERT: Private Keys Exposed

## Critical Security Issue

Private keys have been exposed in the GitHub repository. This is a serious security vulnerability that must be addressed immediately.

## Affected Files

The following private key files were exposed:

1. `services/security/keys/plugins/plugin-private.pem`
2. `services/security/keys/private.key`
3. `services/security/keys/private.pem`

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **CONSIDER THESE KEYS COMPROMISED**: Any private keys that have been committed to the repository should be considered compromised and must be regenerated.

2. **REGENERATE ALL KEYS**: Use the provided script to generate new keys:
   ```bash
   # First, remove the existing keys
   rm -rf services/security/keys/*
   
   # Then generate new keys
   docker compose exec securitymanager node src/scripts/generate-keys.js
   ```

3. **VERIFY .gitignore**: Ensure that the `.gitignore` file contains rules to exclude private keys:
   ```
   # Private keys and sensitive files
   *.pem
   *.key
   *private*
   
   # Specific sensitive directories
   services/security/keys/**
   shared/keys/**
   
   # Allow public keys to be committed
   !*public*.pem
   !*public*.key
   ```

4. **ROTATE ANY AFFECTED CREDENTIALS**: If these keys were used for any production systems, immediately rotate all affected credentials.

## Prevention Measures

1. **NEVER COMMIT PRIVATE KEYS**: Private keys should never be committed to version control.

2. **USE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**: Store sensitive information in environment variables or secure secret management systems.

3. **IMPLEMENT PRE-COMMIT HOOKS**: Consider using pre-commit hooks to prevent sensitive files from being committed.

4. **REGULAR SECURITY AUDITS**: Regularly audit the repository for sensitive information.

## Documentation Updates

The documentation has been updated to emphasize the importance of not committing private keys and to provide clear instructions for generating and managing keys securely.
