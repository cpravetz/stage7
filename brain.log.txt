Create a go to market plan for the TownScape system from Seakaytee.  You can find more about the product on seakaytee.com website.  Identify the potential buyers, their motivators, our positioning for the system, messaging, pricing, timing, communication channels and anything else needed to successfully launch this system.  Then begin implementing the plan.', generate a JSON array of tasks to achieve this goal. Each task object should have 'actionVerb', 'inputs' (as a map of name to {inputValue, inputName, args}), 'description', 'dependencies' (as an array of sourceStepId strings, use step IDs like 'step_1'), and optionally 'recommendedRole'. Ensure the plan is detailed and includes multiple steps with dependencies if logical. The first step will be 'step_1', the next 'step_2', and so on. Dependencies should refer to these generated step IDs.\nIt is critical that the plan is comprehensive and broken down into a sufficient number of granular steps to ensure successful execution. Each step's description should be clear and actionable.\nWhen defining 'dependencies', ensure they accurately reflect the data flow required between steps. Only list direct predecessor step IDs that provide necessary input for the current step.\nIf the goal is complex, consider creating a sub-plan using a nested 'ACCOMPLISH' verb for a major sub-component, or use 'CREATE_SUB_AGENT' if a specialized agent should handle a part of the mission.\nFor 'recommendedRole', suggest roles like 'researcher', 'writer', 'coder', 'validator', 'executor' only if a specialized skill is clearly beneficial for that specific step. Otherwise, omit it or use 'executor'.\nThe output MUST be a valid JSON array of task objects. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON array."

Create a go to market plan for the TownScape system from Seakaytee.  You can find more about the product on seakaytee.com website.  Identify the potential buyers, their motivators, our positioning for the system, messaging, pricing, timing, communication channels and anything else needed to successfully launch this system.  Then begin implementing the plan.', generate a JSON array of tasks to achieve this goal. Each task object should have 'actionVerb', 'inputs' (as a map of name to {inputValue, inputName, args}), 'description', 'dependencies' (as an array of sourceStepId strings, use step IDs like 'step_1'), and optionally 'recommendedRole'. Ensure the plan is detailed and includes multiple steps with dependencies if logical. The first step will be 'step_1', the next 'step_2', and so on. Dependencies should refer to these generated step IDs.\nIt is critical that the plan is comprehensive and broken down into a sufficient number of granular steps to ensure successful execution. Each step's description should be clear and actionable.\nWhen defining 'dependencies', ensure they accurately reflect the data flow required between steps. Only list direct predecessor step IDs that provide necessary input for the current step.\nIf the goal is complex, consider creating a sub-plan using a nested 'ACCOMPLISH' verb for a major sub-component, or use 'CREATE_SUB_AGENT' if a specialized agent should handle a part of the mission.\nFor 'recommendedRole', suggest roles like 'researcher', 'writer', 'coder', 'validator', 'executor' only if a specialized skill is clearly beneficial for that specific step. Otherwise, omit it or use 'executor'.\nThe output MUST be a valid JSON array of task objects. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON array."

Identify the potential buyers, their motivators, our positioning for the system, messaging, pricing, timing, communication channels and anything else needed to successfully launch this system.  Then begin implementing the plan.', generate a JSON array of tasks to achieve this goal. Each task object should have 'actionVerb', 'inputs' (as a map of name to {inputValue, inputName, args}), 'description', 'dependencies' (as an array of sourceStepId strings, use step IDs like 'step_1'), and optionally 'recommendedRole'. Ensure the plan is detailed and includes multiple steps with dependencies if logical. The first step will be 'step_1', the next 'step_2', and so on. Dependencies should refer to these generated step IDs.\nIt is critical that the plan is comprehensive and broken down into a sufficient number of granular steps to ensure successful execution. Each step's description should be clear and actionable.\nWhen defining 'dependencies', ensure they accurately reflect the data flow required between steps. Only list direct predecessor step IDs that provide necessary input for the current step.\nIf the goal is complex, consider creating a sub-plan using a nested 'ACCOMPLISH' verb for a major sub-component, or use 'CREATE_SUB_AGENT' if a specialized agent should handle a part of the mission.\nFor 'recommendedRole', suggest roles like 'researcher', 'writer', 'coder', 'validator', 'executor' only if a specialized skill is clearly beneficial for that specific step. Otherwise, omit it or use 'executor'.\nThe output MUST be a valid JSON array of task objects. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON array."
