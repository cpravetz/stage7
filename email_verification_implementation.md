# Email Verification and Password Reset Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of email verification and password reset functionality in the Stage7 system.

## Components

### Backend (Security Service)

1. **Email Service**
   - Created `EmailService.ts` to handle sending emails
   - Implemented methods for sending verification, password reset, and welcome emails
   - Uses nodemailer for email delivery

2. **Authentication Service**
   - Updated `AuthenticationService.ts` to use EmailService for sending emails
   - Enhanced registration process to generate verification tokens
   - Implemented email verification and password reset functionality

3. **Auth Controller**
   - Added `verifyEmail` endpoint to handle email verification
   - Enhanced `requestPasswordReset` and `resetPassword` endpoints

4. **Routes**
   - Updated auth routes to include new endpoints:
     - `/verify-email`
     - `/request-password-reset`
     - `/reset-password`

### Frontend (MCS React)

1. **Email Verification Component**
   - Created `EmailVerification.tsx` to handle email verification process
   - Extracts token from URL and sends verification request

2. **Password Reset Components**
   - Created `RequestPasswordReset.tsx` for requesting password resets
   - Created `PasswordReset.tsx` for setting a new password

3. **Security Client**
   - Enhanced `SecurityClient.ts` with methods for:
     - `verifyEmail(token)`
     - `requestPasswordReset(email)`
     - `resetPassword(token, newPassword)`

4. **Routing**
   - Updated `App.tsx` to include routes for:
     - `/verify-email`
     - `/reset-password`
     - `/forgot-password`

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be set in the Security Service's `.env` file:

```
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@stage7.ai

# Frontend URL (for email links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Flow

1. **Registration**
   - User registers with email and password
   - System generates verification token
   - Email sent with verification link

2. **Email Verification**
   - User clicks link in email
   - Frontend extracts token from URL
   - Token sent to backend for verification
   - User account marked as verified

3. **Password Reset**
   - User requests password reset
   - System generates reset token
   - Email sent with reset link
   - User clicks link and sets new password
   - System verifies token and updates password

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are time-limited (verification: 24h, reset: 1h)
- Password reset emails don't confirm email existence (prevents enumeration)
- All tokens are single-use and invalidated after use
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Register a new user
2. Check the console for the verification email (in development)
3. Use the verification link to verify the email
4. Request a password reset
5. Use the reset link to set a new password
6. Log in with the new password

## Production Deployment

For production deployment, configure a real SMTP server in the environment variables. Options include:

- Amazon SES
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- Office 365/Exchange
- Gmail (with app password)
